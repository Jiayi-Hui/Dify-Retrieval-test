3. Prioritize contact attempts with selected agencies during peak business hours to optimize the likelihood of speaking to a representative.
4. Attempt initial contact during non-peak hours to improve connection chances.

6. Use alternative communication channels, such as email or direct agent numbers, to initiate contact if telephone attempts fail.
7. Expand the outreach by including additional reputable agencies specializing in investment properties to improve the chance of success.

## Description
This document addresses the common issue of availability and pricing inquiries for retail outlets. Customers often seek information on product availability, pricing, and stock status, which requires a systematic approach to gather and verify data from various sources.

## Solution steps
1. Conduct an online search to collect relevant product details, including price, available sizes, color variants, and release date.
2. Extract key product identifiers (e.g., SKU numbers) for different colorways to aid in inventory checks.
3. Identify and compile a list of local retail outlets and their contact information for the brand.
4. Initiate contact with these outlets via phone to inquire about product availability and pricing.
5. If local outlet inquiries are insufficient or unavailable, contact the brand’s centralized customer service for broader inventory and pricing information.
6. Summarize the collected information, including product price, current stock status, and any noted restock patterns or recommendations (e.g., checking the brand’s app on specific days).
7. Collect user-provided location information to determine nearby retail options.
8. Search for nearby retail outlets of the identified business using the user's location data.
9. Gather information on available channels (local physical stores, online sites, and customer service lines) for confirming inventory and pricing.
10. When interacting with the automated system, use the phone keypad for navigating options, ensuring you correctly press the required digits when prompted.
11. If a store requires additional product details (e.g., SKU number), locate the necessary identifier from a reliable online source.
12. Re-contact the relevant store or use alternative channels (such as online ordering or main customer service lines) with complete product identifiers to confirm current inventory.
13. If initial calls do not yield results, consider checking alternative retailers or online platforms to find comprehensive availability information.
14. Contact secondary retailers in the local area to verify product availability, being ready to obtain any additional identifiers (such as the SKU) if required.
15. Based on collected information, provide the user with available options and guide them on further steps or alternative approaches if necessary.
16. Document and relay the verified information back to the user to assist in decision making.

6. Compile and complete all required documentation and forms as specified by the chosen lenders, ensuring all mandatory information (e.g., identification, housing status, and additional financial details) is included.
7. Initiate outreach to the identified lenders via available communication methods (phone, email, or online applications). If electronic or remote contact is unsuccessful, advise the user to follow up in person at the nearest lender branch.
