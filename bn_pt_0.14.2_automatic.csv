## Description
Unresolved fraudulent charges occur when unauthorized transactions appear on a customer's account, and the issue remains unsettled despite previous attempts to resolve it. This problem requires a systematic approach to gather evidence, communicate effectively with the service provider, and potentially escalate the issue if initial resolution efforts fail.

## Solution steps
1. Collect all relevant information regarding the fraudulent transactions, including transaction details, dates, previous dispute attempts, and supporting documentation.
2. Ensure that supporting evidence such as police reports, previous complaint references, and any other verification documents are available.
3. Confirm that the account details reflect that the card is lost or stolen, and that a formal dispute has been initiated.
4. Compile all gathered information into a complete complaint package.
5. Use current, accurate authentication information to contact the service provider directly through their official channels.
6. Communicate a clear description of the issue and request action based on the business’s fraud or complaint resolution process.
7. Address any discrepancies between the provided details and the business records, and request updated information if necessary.
8. If the direct contact does not resolve the issue, consider escalating the complaint through appropriate regulatory or arbitration channels.
9. Review the outcome and advise on further steps if the complaint is not resolved.
10. Record the outcome and prepare for potential follow-up actions if further assistance is required.

## Description
This document addresses the common issue of availability and pricing inquiries for retail outlets. Customers often seek information on product availability, pricing, and stock status, which requires a systematic approach to gather and verify data from various sources.

## Solution steps
1. Conduct an online search to collect relevant product details, including price, available sizes, color variants, and release date.
2. Extract key product identifiers (e.g., SKU numbers) for different colorways to aid in inventory checks.
3. Identify and compile a list of local retail outlets and their contact information for the brand.
4. Initiate contact with these outlets via phone to inquire about product availability and pricing.
5. If local outlet inquiries are insufficient or unavailable, contact the brand’s centralized customer service for broader inventory and pricing information.
6. Summarize the collected information, including product price, current stock status, and any noted restock patterns or recommendations (e.g., checking the brand’s app on specific days).
7. Collect user-provided location information to determine nearby retail options.
8. Search for nearby retail outlets of the identified business using the user's location data.
9. Gather information on available channels (local physical stores, online sites, and customer service lines) for confirming inventory and pricing.
10. When interacting with the automated system, use the phone keypad for navigating options, ensuring you correctly press the required digits when prompted.
11. If a store requires additional product details (e.g., SKU number), locate the necessary identifier from a reliable online source.
12. Re-contact the relevant store or use alternative channels (such as online ordering or main customer service lines) with complete product identifiers to confirm current inventory.
13. If initial calls do not yield results, consider checking alternative retailers or online platforms to find comprehensive availability information.
14. Contact secondary retailers in the local area to verify product availability, being ready to obtain any additional identifiers (such as the SKU) if required.
15. Based on collected information, provide the user with available options and guide them on further steps or alternative approaches if necessary.
16. Document and relay the verified information back to the user to assist in decision making.

## Description
Subscription cancellation involves terminating an ongoing service agreement with The Economist. This process requires careful attention to detail to ensure that the subscription is effectively and officially ended, preventing future charges or service continuation.

## Solution steps
1. Identify the subscription service and clearly define the cancellation objective.
2. Gather all necessary subscription details from the user, including account identifiers, contact information, and any supporting details (e.g., subscription type, cancellation reason, optional alternative contact data).
3. Determine if a self-service cancellation option (such as an online account portal) is available and advise the user accordingly.
4. Verify and confirm the official cancellation contact channels for the service provider.
5. Initiate the cancellation request through the primary contact channel using the collected subscription details.
6. If the initial request fails (e.g., no response or delivery issues), follow up by using an alternative contact method or providing additional identifying information as needed.
7. Document all communications and the details provided during each step of the cancellation process.
8. Request and verify a confirmation of cancellation from the service provider.

Subscription cancellation involves terminating a user's ongoing service agreement with a business, often requiring specific procedures to ensure proper handling of refunds and cessation of services. This process can vary depending on the business's infrastructure and available cancellation methods.

## Solution steps

2. Confirm that all necessary information is available before proceeding to minimize back-and-forth communication.
3. Determine the appropriate cancellation method based on the business’s online presence or lack thereof.
4. If the business lacks an online cancellation option, prepare to contact them using the provided phone number or other available contact channels.
5. Initiate contact with the business to request the cancellation and refund as specified by the user.
6. If the primary contact method fails, advise the user to seek alternative contact options (like local directories or social media) for further assistance.
7. Advise the user to review previous communications for any additional cancellation instructions.
8. Communicate the outcome of the cancellation attempt to the user and advise on any necessary follow-up actions.
